# DurraniOS v2.0

**DurraniOS** is my hyper-immersive, browser-based operating system serving as my digital portfolio. I designed it to bridge the gap between my work in software engineering, creative writing, and people operations through a unified, desktop-like interface.

> **System Requirement:** Optimized for desktop / laptop displays (1024px+). 
> *A mobile-responsive adapter is currently in development.*

## System Architecture (Apps)

I have built a suite of native applications to showcase my different professional personas:

*   **PeopleOps.app**: A dashboard where I visualize HR strategies, team growth metrics, and operational KPIs.
*   **Bard.app**: A specialized reader for my creative writing portfolios, anthologies, and manuscripts.
*   **Transmission Terminal (Contact)**: A sci-fi inspired communication hub featuring:
    *   **EmailJS Integration** for serverless, direct data uplinks.
    *   **Honeypot Security** & Spam protection.
    *   **Quick Actions** for instant social connectivity (LinkedIn, GitHub).
*   **Resume.app**: A dedicated PDF viewer and download manager for my professional resumes.
*   **Terminal**: A command-line interface for power users to navigate the system.
